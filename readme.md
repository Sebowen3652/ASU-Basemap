My custom base map is not particularly practical. When designing it I wanted to emphasize roadways
and water features. This is why I made them white and yellow respectively. I had originally chosen
colors that made more sense from a practical standpoint. Softer, more blended colors. Then I decided
to make them the colors of ASU. Although it does not look all that good from a cartographic perspective, I
think it would look pretty good in a marketing use for the school. Either way, I now know how to make custom
base maps (including ones that are more useful than this one). I think the UI for the program
is very easy to use and design. I had originally had trouble finding out how to change the colors
of individual feature categories but, as one can see, I was able to figure it out after spending a few minutes
on the program.
